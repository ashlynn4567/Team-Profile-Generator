# Team-Profile-Generator
This is my tenth challenge assignment for the University of Oregon Coding Bootcamp 2022. The challenge is to create an application using Node.js that gathers information about employees to generate an HTML webpage displaying summaries for each person. There will also be basic code tests using the Jest framework.
